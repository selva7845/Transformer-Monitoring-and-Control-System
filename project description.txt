📝 Project Description
Title: Transformer Monitoring and Control System
Platform: Embedded Systems (PIC16F877A)
Tools Used: MPLAB, Hi-Tech C, Proteus ISIS

This project involves the design and implementation of a Transformer Monitoring and Control System using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The system continuously monitors simulated transformer parameters—current and voltage—through the microcontroller’s built-in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

When the monitored values exceed predefined safety thresholds (e.g., current > 50A, voltage > 240V), the system performs the following actions:

🔔 Displays a warning message on a 16x2 LCD display

📡 Sends real-time alerts via UART to a virtual terminal (simulated in Proteus)

🔴 Turns OFF an indicator LED to indicate unsafe conditions

To resume normal operation, the system requires a multi-stage security process using a 4x4 matrix keypad, including:

Entry of a Call PIN

Entry of an OTP (One-Time Password)

Entry of a Final OTP to confirm task completion

This access control mechanism ensures that only authorized personnel can reset the alert and safely restart transformer operations, simulating secure field-level maintenance in a power distribution system.

📟 Key Functionalities
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously reads analog signals representing current and voltage.

Fault Detection: Detects overcurrent and overvoltage by comparing ADC values to set limits.

Alert Mechanism: Sends warning messages over UART and displays them on the LCD.

Secure Access Control: Requires stepwise PIN and OTP entry for system reset.

User Interface: LCD displays live readings, alerts, and instructions.

LED Status Indicator: Visual cue for normal (ON) or fault (OFF) states.
